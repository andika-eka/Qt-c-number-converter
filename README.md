# Qt-c-number-converter
Qt 4.0 i made a number converter for Decimal, Octal, Hexa decimal and Binary number. This project was originally for college assignment, So it's using bahasa indonesia for theUI. At the time i made this project i was still a beginner. So, the code is very sloppy and unoptimized.
